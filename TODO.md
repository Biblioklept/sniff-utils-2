# TODO / Suggested Mods
### These are mods that have been suggested and may make it into a future update:

~~- A way to save your lobby's settings so everytime you buy a contract they're automatically set~~

Additional notes: Use **[Lobby Settings](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/lobby_settings.html) by TdlQ. Could develop but this is perfectly fine and well made. Also, if you're feeling particularly bold. You can use my **[T-PACK mod.txt file](https://gist.github.com/Biblioklept/4db89e8ef03738c99b9c73bb64fa89fa)** which slims down the amount of mods installed from 48 to 17.

- Add more modules to the options. Currently files are just merged into the lua without much more effort.
