# TODO / Suggested Mods
### These are mods that have been suggested and may make it into a future update:

- [Bag Carrying Tilt Removal](https://modworkshop.net/mod/16487) by Seven, uploaded to MWS by EdisLeado

Additional notes: none!

- A way to save your lobby's settings so everytime you buy a contract they're automatically set

Additional notes: will be complicated to do but I'll try to implement something long-term

- [No Cloaker Camera Movement](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24339) by Zdann

Additional notes: not planned for a close release but rather long term
