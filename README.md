# Sniff's Utils
**A personal collection of PAYDAY 2 Quality-of-Life mods, made to reduce mod count and ease readability.** Made for personal use but released for anyone who is bothered by this as well.

This currently includes the following mods:
- **No More Ads** by kaiden
- **SteamOverFBI** by Literally the Crash, fixed by Trueboy
- **Cheater Kicker*** by Sora
- **Reconnect to Server** by Luffy
- **Low Violence Mode** by Schmuddel

- **PocoHUD Sticky Interaction Standalone** by test1
- **Stop the crimespree loss on crash** by Sora
- **Shorter Names for Weapon Color Categories** by Cyril DeRoach
- **Load Steam Inventory Once** by Sora

**Uses the Cheater Kicker Plus edit (can't find an author for it) and is slightly modified further by me*
