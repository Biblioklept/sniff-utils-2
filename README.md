# Sniff's Utils

**A personal collection of PAYDAY 2 Quality-of-Life mods, made to reduce mod count and ease control of its features.** Made for personal use but released as a lightweight out-of-the-box modded experience for players who have never modded the game before, or those who find it comfortable to have a bunch of their common mods in the same place.

Any other mod will work fine with this as long as there's not any conflicts. **If you suffer from crashes that mention Sniff's Utils directly in their log, please let me know through an issue here or a comment in ModWorkshop so I can fix it!**

# I think X mod should be added!
First of all, check for mods that have already been suggested [here](https://github.com/SniffDev/sniff-utils/blob/main/TODO.md).

If your suggestion isn't a duplicate, check the [suggestion guidelines](https://github.com/SniffDev/sniff-utils/blob/main/SUGGESTIONS.md), your mod may be considered over others for certain criteria mentioned there. There are also instructions on how to add your own mods if you just want them on *your* game and not for everyone to download here.
