# I think X mod should be added!

While I do take all kinds of mod suggestions, I prioritize ones over others depending on the following criteria:

### REQUIRED
- The mod/s you suggest must be **free to re-upload**. You can check if this is so on the mod's ModWorkshop or GitHub (if it has one) pages. I do not have any relations with mod authors so updating would be far more annoying if I had to contact everyone manually. 

- **No gameplay changes**. This is supposed to be a quality-of-life mod that makes the current experience more comfortable/enjoyable. More info on this later.

### OPTIONAL
<sub>Your suggestion doesn't need to meet the following requirements but I may consider them over others that don't.</sub>

- **The less intrusive and more newbie-friendly, the better**. To adapt to all types of players who might download Sniff's Utils, it's preferable if nothing severely impacts how the game feels or looks.

- **Utility over looks**. Extra points if your suggestion solves an issue with the vanilla game that isn't necessarily fatal but rather annoying.
